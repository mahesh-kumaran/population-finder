# population-finder :family:

Simple angular application that shows population on a selected country and age-group.

This application is just intended to have fun with Angular and get the know the basics.

You can get this up and running by simply starting a http-server using node ```http-server -p <port-number>``` or python ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port-number>```.
